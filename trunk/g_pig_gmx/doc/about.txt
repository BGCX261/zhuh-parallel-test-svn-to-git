/*
	this is a program design for calculating the position of ions in the cavity of 
G-quartets.It's already konw that for the ions of K,the stably place is the middle
state between two G-quartets.In the program,we get the z-axis plumb the 
surface of G-quartets.and get the distribution of ions  along the z-axis.
	I get the least-squares fitted coordinates of base to calculate the z-axis. what
is the same with 3DNA does.
